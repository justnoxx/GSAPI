GSAPI version 0.1 (heavily untested)
=================

This module provides an interface to the gsapi
functions of GNU Gostscript.

You normally won't need this module, it's far easier
to pipe to gs under Unix.

You need libgs - which is normally not available under
most Linux Distributions - and you need the "iapi.h"
header file somewhere in your PATH.

You normally want to use the tie-method, here an example:

my $output;
{ local *FH;
   tie *FH, "GSAPI", stdout => sub { $output .= $_[0]; length $_[0]};
   print FH "12345679 9 mul pstack quit\n";
}

ok($output =~ /111111111/);
